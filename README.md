# Countersurveillance DiscoTechs
<b>What is a DiscoTech?</b><br>
A DiscoTech (short for “Discovering Technology” events) is a community-based, community-organized, multimedia workshop and fair. At a DiscoTech, participants learn more about the impacts and possibilities of technology, and take part in fun, interactive and media-based workshops. Discotech workshops are designed to demystify technology and create a space where we can inform and engage our community [...] A Discotech utilizes the unique skills and expertise within each community and morphs to adapt to changing needs.

<b>What happens at Countersurveillance DiscoTechs?</b><br>
At countersurveillance DiscoTechs, we focus on creating welcoming spaces where a wide range of people (not just techies and activists) feel welcome exploring, learning about, and sharing each others’ experiences with surveillance. We invite community organizations, technologists, developers, and designers to come to the DiscoTechs to sprint/hack on projects together. There are speakers and workshops. We dive in deep to understand surveillance tools, systems, and histories. We also get hands-on with tools and approaches that can strengthen our communities’ privacy, safety, and security. We break down structural inequality in surveillance regimes that disproportionately target people of color, working people, immigrants, and activists. Our goals are to understand surveillance in everyday life, and to work hands-on with community-based organizations to strengthen countersurveillance strategies and tools.<br>

The MIT Codesign Studio team organized, hosted, participated in, and supported several countersurveillance DiscoTechs and hackathons during the spring of 2014. At the Boston DiscoTech I gave a presentation on the SURVANT-Cryp project and later participated in a variety of countersurveillance workshops and hacking projects. At this event I was introduced to <a href="vojo.co">Vojo</a>, a platform that allows people to post stories from inexpensive mobile phones via voice calls, SMS, and MMS. Professor Sasha Costanza-Chock led a group of attendees (including myself) around the MIT campus, where we captured images of surveillance cameras and then posted them to Vojo (http://vojo.co/en/discotech). This walking practice highlighted the ubiquitousness of the Cambridge surveillance apparatus and enabled our group to establish a polyvocal counter-map of the campus. 

In the winter and spring of 2016 SURVANT-Cryp will be facilitating a series of countersurveillance walking + mapping exercises in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. Like the walk that took place at MIT in 2014, the Brooklyn excursions will utilize the Vojo platform to locate and map surveillance cameras and other security equipment. These exercises will also focus on problematizing policies of enclosure and privatization by identifying disused space that could potentially be reclaimed as commons.
