# DiscoTech
A DiscoTech is a community-based, community-organized, multimedia workshop and fair. At a DiscoTech, participants learn more about the impacts and possibilities of technology, and take part in fun, interactive and media-based workshops. Discotech workshops are designed to demystify technology and create a space where we can inform and engage our community [...] A Discotech utilizes the unique skills and expertise within each community and morphs to adapt to changing needs.

<b>What happens at Countersurveillance DiscoTechs?</b><br>

At countersurveillance DiscoTechs, we focus on creating welcoming spaces where a wide range of people (not just techies and activists) feel welcome exploring, learning about, and sharing each others’ experiences with surveillance. We invite community organizations, technologists, developers, and designers to come to the DiscoTechs to sprint/hack on projects together. There are speakers and workshops. We dive in deep to understand surveillance tools, systems, and histories. We also get hands-on with tools and approaches that can strengthen our communities’ privacy, safety, and security. We break down structural inequality in surveillance regimes that disproportionately target people of color, working people, immigrants, and activists. Our goals are to understand surveillance in everyday life, and to work hands-on with community-based organizations to strengthen countersurveillance strategies and tools.<br>
